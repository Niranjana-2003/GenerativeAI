The project is a streamlit based application which allows user to upload a file ,extract text from the file , and generate a summaryof the text using openAIs language model.The project utilizes the streamlit framework,which is a popular python library for building interactive web application .
The main functionalities are:
File upload : The application allows users to upload a file, typically a pdf containing text content that need to be processed
Text extraction : Once the file is uploaded ,the application extract text from the pdf . It utilizes PyPDF2 library to extract text from the file
Summary Generation : The extracted text is passed to openAIs languge model .It can understant and generate human like text . it uses advanced technology like deeplearning to generate the summary of the uploaded file
It provide a user friendly interface to view the extracted text and summary 
The purpose of this project is to demonstrates how to build a simple text extraction and summarization application using openAI and streamlit
